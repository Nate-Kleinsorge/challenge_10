## Description: 
I was motivated to learn more about command line applications, and what use they have. I also wanted to build something that could allow companies to keep trakc of their employees.
I built this so People can have a nicely formatted website to view all their employees.
It allows the user to stay organized and know where they have employees to spare.
I learned that command line applications can be used to build websites.
